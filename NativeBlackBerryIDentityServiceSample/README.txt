Description of BlackBerry Identity Service:
BlackBerry Identity Service is a standardized interface for accessing identifiable information about the user across multiple Identity Providers or IDPs. Supported Identity providers effectively make it possible for developers to pull out data about a user from multiple registered sources, based on the consent of the user. 

Feature Summary: BlackBerry ID Identity Provider
With BlackBerry ID you are using the built in device authentication to authenticate with your backend. All you have to do is link your existing authentication system with BlackBerry Identity Service and use BBID authentication to identify a user. This would require a 3rd party application to consume the UID that BlackBerry ID provides and map it to your existing account system.
